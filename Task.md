# Remake The EternalBlue Website

You broke the EternalBlue's website, it's now up to you to make a new one.

Your task is to make a new website for EternalBlue with the same core functionality.
Creativity and improvements in how the website is built are encouraged, but aren't a necessity.
It's up to you to choose the best tools for the job (languages, frameworks, etc), but the choices you make should be sensible.
Your submission is judged solely on how well it fulfills the requirements of the task.

**It's important that:**
1. The website has an easily maintainable and readable codebase with good coding practices, so it won't break again
2. Your solution isn't less secure than ours

The site should have 3 screens:
1. The first screen should have a password field and a login button. It should have a hidden input field with the first password in a ASCII format. When the user types in the correct password navigating to page 2.
2. The second screen should have an input field and a login button. It should contain the image from the EternalBlue website. When the user types in the correct password navigate to Page 3.
3. The third screen should include a title congratulating the user on logging in. It should include a download button. The download button should download the Task.md file.

If you don't want to design and style a website with HTML/CSS from scratch, you are welcome to use our design. We do not mind if the user facing part is pretty :).

When the site is done, send a zip file of the codebase to: 
eternalblue@ifs.aero
